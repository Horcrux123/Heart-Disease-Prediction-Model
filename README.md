# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
This is simple and effective preddiction model of heart disease that takes the input from the user and based on it gives a prediction. This model uses Logistic Regression analysis for the preddiction and the output is in the form of the user giving input to the system and based on this , the system gives two outputs :
1) You are healthy
2) Consult a doctor

The input parameters for the heart health prediction model typically include various health-related features. Based on the context of your previous messages, here are the common input parameters you might use:
1) Age: The age of the individual (in years).
2) Sex: Gender of the individual (0 for female, 1 for male).
3) Chest Pain Type: Categorical variable indicating the type of chest pain (often encoded as integers, e.g., 0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic).
4) Resting Blood Pressure: Blood pressure measured at rest (in mm Hg).
5) Cholesterol Level: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
6) Fasting Blood Sugar: Indicates whether fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
7) Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Results of an electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest (often encoded as integers, e.g., 0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
8) Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: The maximum heart rate achieved during a stress test.
9) Exercise Induced Angina: Whether the individual experiences angina induced by exercise (1 = yes; 0 = no).
10) ST Depression: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (a measure of heart function).
11) Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment: The slope of the ST segment during peak exercise (e.g., 0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping).
12) Number of Major Vessels: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
13) Thalassemia: A blood disorder that affects hemoglobin; often encoded as categorical values (e.g., 0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect).
